Whebap is a Web application microframework which is:

 1. Minimalistic (one file).
 2. WSGI support.
 3. Routable.
 4. With a template function.
 5. Without any magic.
 6. For a tiny website (10-20 pages) developed by a single developer.

Motivation:
I looked at existing microframeworks but each of them has
a problem one for another:

 * Flask (Way too big!)
 * Bottle (Mixed code for Python 2/3, Ugh.)
 * Itty (No template.)

I wanted something my little brain can easily understand.
So I decided to write my own.
